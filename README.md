##  Learning Journey
 ##   About the Program

- **Institution:** Stanford University
- **Duration:** 6 weeks (April - June 2026)
- **Acceptance Rate:** ~12% (selected from 15,000+ global applicants)
- **Format:** Weekly interactive sections, coding assignments, and final project
- **Focus:** Python fundamentals, algorithmic thinking, real-world problem-solving

##   Course Progress

### Week 1: Introduction to Programming with Karel  
**April 2026**

Started with Karel the Robot — a visual programming environment designed by Stanford to teach core concepts.

**Concepts learned:**
- Control flow: `while` loops and `if/else` statements
- Defining and calling functions with `def`
- Problem decomposition
- Basic algorithmic thinking

**What is Karel?**  
A robot that lives in a grid world and can:
- `move()` - Move forward one space
- `turn_left()` - Rotate 90° left
- `put_beeper()` - Place a marker
- `pick_beeper()` - Pick up a marker

Simple environment, powerful concepts. Great way to visualize logic before diving into syntax.

---

### Week 2: Control Flow & Conditionals with Karel  
**April - May 2026**

Built on Week 1 foundations with more complex Karel problems using conditional logic.

**New concepts:**
- Boolean functions for decision-making:
  - `front_is_clear()` - Check if robot can move forward
  - `beepers_present()` - Check if there's a beeper at current location
  - `beepers_in_bag()` - Check if robot has beepers to place
  - `left_is_clear()`, `right_is_clear()` - Check adjacent spaces
  - `facing_north()`, `facing_south()`, `facing_east()`, `facing_west()` - Check orientation

**Key takeaway:**  
Learning to combine conditions to solve increasingly complex problems. Karel teaches you to *think* like a programmer before worrying about syntax.

---

### Week 3: Real Python — Beyond Karel  
**May 2026**

Transitioned from Karel's visual world to writing "real" Python code.

**Topics covered:**
- `print()` and `input()` - User interaction
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Integer division (`//`) and remainders (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Type conversion: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Rounding with `round()`
- String formatting with f-strings
- Random number generation with `random` module
- Constants and multi-branch conditionals (`if/elif/else`)

**Programs created:**
- `hello_name.py` - Greet the user by name using input and string formatting
- `multiply.py` - Multiply two numbers entered by the user
- `mad_libs.py` - Insert user-provided color, adjective and object into a pre-built sentence
- `dice_roller.py` - Simulate a dice roll using random numbers
- `mars_weight.py` - Convert Earth weight to Mars equivalent (37.8% of Earth weight)
- `planetary_weight.py` - Convert Earth weight to any planet using gravity constants
- `dog_years.py` - Convert a person's age into dog years
- `haiku_generator.py` - Generate a haiku (5-7-5 syllables) from user input

**What clicked:**  
Karel taught the logic; Python gives it real-world application. Every concept from Karel — loops, conditionals, functions — now works on actual data and produces meaningful output. The jump from "move a robot" to "calculate something useful" makes the purpose of programming click.

### Week 4: Functions, Parameters & Game Development  
**May 2026**

Dove deeper into functions with parameters, return values, and building complete programs.

**Topics covered:**
- Functions with multiple parameters and return values
- Game state management across function calls
- Random number generation with `random` module
- Control flow with `while` loops and conditionals
- Boolean logic and comparisons
- Input validation and error handling
- Mathematical sequences and algorithms

**Programs created:**
- `liftoff.py` - Countdown loop from 10 to 1
- `random_numbers.py` - Generate and print 10 random numbers (1-100)
- `doubler.py` - Double numbers until reaching 100
- `joke_bot.py` - Simple interactive chatbot
- `hailstone.py` - Collatz conjecture: divide evens by 2, multiply odds by 3+1 until reaching 1
- `high_low_game.py` - Guessing game comparing your number vs computer's
- `the_game_of_nimm.py` - Two-player strategy game: alternate taking 1-2 stones, last to take loses
**Main project:**
`math_game.py` -  Progressive difficulty math challenge game

**What clicked:**  
Functions transform code from linear scripts into modular, reusable components. Return values allow functions to communicate state changes, enabling complex multi-level game mechanics. The strategy games (High-Low, Nimm) showed how the same Boolean logic used in simple conditionals can power complete turn-based game systems.

### Week 5: Graphics & Visual Programming 
**May 2026**

Transitioned from text-based programs to visual programming using Stanford's Graphics library.

**Topics covered:**
- Canvas creation and coordinate systems
- Drawing shapes: circles, ovals, rectangles, lines
- Color systems and `random.choice()` for random colors
- Function composition: functions calling other functions
- Positioning elements with x/y coordinates
- Nested loops for grid-based patterns
- Breaking visual programs into parameterized functions

**Programs created:**
- `box_row.py` - Draw a row of 5 equally-sized boxes filling the bottom of the canvas
- `draw_flag.py` - Recreate the flag of Indonesia using rectangles
- `my_flag.py` - Recreate my own country's flag (Argentina 🇦🇷)
- `pyramid.py` - Draw a brick pyramid where each row decreases by one brick
- `quilt.py` - Generate a repeating patch pattern to simulate a quilt blanket
- `random_circles.py` - Draws 20 circles at random positions with random colors on the canvas
- `scene_with_functions.py` - Draw a natural scene broken into parameterized functions

**Key insight:**  
The same programming concepts (loops, functions, randomness) now create visual output. Each project built on the last: from a single row of boxes → a pyramid → a full quilt pattern. The final scene project tied everything together — using functions with parameters to draw reusable visual components.

### Week 6: Lists, Dictionaries & Data Structures  
**May 2026**

Final week of live sessions. Moved from visual programming into working with 
data structures to store, organize, and analyze information.

**Topics covered:**
- Lists: ordered collections, iteration, and file loading
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs for structured data
- Looping over lists and dictionaries
- File reading: loading data from `.txt` files into lists
- Counting occurrences with dictionaries
- String formatting for aligned output (`f"{word : <8}"`)
- Dictionary methods: `.get()`, `.pop()`, `del`, `.keys()`

**Programs created:**
- `compute_average.py` - Load numbers from a file and calculate their average
- `quizzlet.py` - Spanish vocabulary quiz that loops over a dictionary and tracks score
- `baby_vocab.py` - Count word frequency from a file and display a text-based histogram
- `[one more coming soon]`

**Key insight:**  
Lists and dictionaries are the backbone of real-world programming. 
A list loads raw data from a file; a dictionary gives that data structure and meaning. 
The Baby Vocab project tied both together: load words into a list, 
count them into a dictionary, display results as a histogram — a complete data pipeline in pure Python.

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

Beyond just Python syntax, Code in Place emphasizes:
- **Problem decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into smaller functions
- **Algorithmic thinking** - Planning solutions before coding
- **Clean code** - Writing readable, maintainable programs
- **Debugging** - Systematic problem-solving when code doesn't work
- **Visual thinking** - Translating logic into graphics and coordinate systems
- **Data structures** - Organizing and manipulating information with lists and dictionaries

The Karel-to-Python progression is brilliant: you learn the **concepts** first (loops, conditionals, functions) in a forgiving visual environment, then apply them to real code — and eventually to graphics, games, and data structures.
