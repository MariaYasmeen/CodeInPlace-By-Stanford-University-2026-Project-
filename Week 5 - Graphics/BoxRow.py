Let's practice making graphics with lots of repeated elements. 
This will help us get familiar with working with multiple shapes and pixel calculations!
Make a line of boxes as shown below, such that the boxes fill the bottom of the canvas. 
Each box should have a width and height of BOX_SIZE, making a total of 5 boxes perfectly in line with one another
